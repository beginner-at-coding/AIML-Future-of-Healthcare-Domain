For most of the parts in the code you will directory location named after my PC, please make the changes accordinly. 
Also you will run into error many times because of the missing modules, so keep the check on the modules. Also there will be more error which is LONG PATH error you can fix this one by going to the Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem and Select LONG PATH ENABLED and change the value from 0 to 1 and hit save.

You are ready to go with you FIRST AIML Project.

Thank you.
