#Possible error fixes are listed down below:-
1. For most of the parts in the code you will see directory location named after my PC, change it to yours. 
2. You will run into module missing error many times because of the missing modules, so keep the check on the modules and install them one by one or either by Requirements.txt. 
3. LONG PATH error you can fix this one by going to the Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem and select 
LONG PATH ENABLED and change the value from 0 to 1 and hit save.

You are ready to go with you FIRST AIML Project.

Thank you.
